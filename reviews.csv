The house is super beautiful, mega equippied, easy to mantain tidy and clean. And she and her family had been a super host. The neigbourhood is calm and pretty, and near two beautiful streets: Dundas on one side and Queen in the other. We felt very very comfortable and happy at their home. We have no more than THANKS to Alex and her family. Best stay we had ever.

Anything we could have needed was available and the experience of working with Alexandra was wonderful! The neighborhood is very easy to get around and there's a ton of great restaurants, coffee shops and stores within walking distance. It is definitely one of the nicest houses I've ever had the chance to stay in! Anyone would be lucky to get the same experience in this great home, in a great city!"

Thanks Alexandra!"
