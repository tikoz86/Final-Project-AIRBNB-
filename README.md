# Final-Project Desription
Airbnb is the worldâ€™s most prominent online hospitality marketplace. It has a publicly available dataset, 
divided region wise which has been used in my predictions and analytics to determine how various features of property 
correlate to the price of the listing in the Airbnb website. In order to make predictions more robust, I also used the 
text reviews by the customers and performed sentiment analysis on it, subsequently adding it as a feature for training 
the model. For the training part, I used data for Toronto but the model can be used for any region since 
the data structure is uniform throughout. For future work, I hope to collect more extensive and more diverse dataset 
to enhance its performance and generalizability.
